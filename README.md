# Terraform Provider Mondoo

> Status: It is currently in beta. Please report any issues you encounter.

The Mondoo Provider allows [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to manage [Mondoo](https://mondoo.com) resources.

## Provider Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    mondoo = {
      source = "mondoohq/mondoo"
    }
  }
}

provider "mondoo" {
  region = "us" # use "eu" for the European region
}
```

### Requirements

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll need:

- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install) >= 1.0
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) >= 1.21

## Developing the provider

To enter development mode, run `make dev/enter`. This will build the provider inside the Terraform plugins directory
and generate a Terraform configuration `~/.terraformrc`.

Once in development mode, you can change directories to any of the Terraform plans in the [examples/](examples/) folder.

To exit development mode, run `make dev/exit`. Note that this will remove the Terraform configuration `~/.terraformrc`.

### Documentation and Test

To generate or update documentation, run `make generate`.

In order to run the full suite of Acceptance tests, run `make testacc`.

_Note:_ Acceptance tests create real resources, and often cost money to run.

```shell
make testacc
```

This provider is built on the [Terraform Plugin Framework](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework). The
template repository built on the [Terraform Plugin SDK](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk) can be found
at [terraform-provider-scaffolding](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-scaffolding). The directory
structure contains the following directories:

- A resource and a data source (`internal/provider/`),
- Examples (`examples/`) and generated documentation (`docs/`),
- Miscellaneous meta files.

### Building The Provider

1. Clone the repository
1. Enter the repository directory
1. Build the provider using the Go `install` command:

```shell
go install
```

To use the local provider, add the following to your Terraform configuration `~/.terraformrc` and provide it with the absolute path to your `/go/bin` directory:

```hcl
provider_installation {
  dev_overrides {
    "mondoohq/mondoo" = "/Users/USERNAME/go/bin"
  }

  # For all other providers, install them directly from their origin provider
  # registries as normal. If you omit this, Terraform will _only_ use
  # the dev_overrides block, and so no other providers will be available.
  direct {}
}
```

See [Terraform documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/config/config-file#explicit-installation-method-configuration)
for more details about provider install configuration.

### Adding Dependencies

This provider uses [Go modules](https://go.dev/wiki/Modules).
Please see the Go documentation for the most up to date information about using Go modules.

To add a new dependency `github.com/author/dependency` to your Terraform provider:

```shell
go get github.com/author/dependency
go mod tidy
```

Then commit the changes to `go.mod` and `go.sum`.

### Adding Resources

The easiest way to create a new resource is to use
the [Terraform Plugin Framework Code Generator](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-codegen-framework)

```shell
go install github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-codegen-framework/cmd/tfplugingen-framework@latest
```

Now you can scaffold a new resource:

```shell
tfplugingen-framework scaffold resource --name policy_upload --output-dir internal/provider
```
