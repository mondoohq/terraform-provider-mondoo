# Mondoo Provider

The Mondoo provider is used to configure your Mondoo Platform infrastructure.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    mondoo = {
      source  = "mondoohq/mondoo"
      version = ">= 0.4.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "mondoo" {
  region = "us" # use "eu" for the European region
}
```

## Authentication

By default, the provider will use the Mondoo CLI configuration file to authenticate to the Mondoo Platform. The CLI configuration file is located at `~/.config/mondoo/mondoo.yml` on Linux and macOS, and `%HomePath%\mondoo\mondoo.yml` on Windows.
