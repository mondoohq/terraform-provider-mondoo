# Mondoo Provider

The Mondoo provider is used to configure your Mondoo Platform infrastructure.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    mondoo = {
      source  = "mondoohq/mondoo"
      version = ">= 0.4.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "mondoo" {
  region = "us" # use "eu" for the European region
}
```

## Authentication

To configure the Mondoo provider you will need a service account with **Editor** permissions, to create a service
account, see [Create and Manage Service Accounts](https://mondoo.com/docs/platform/maintain/access/service_accounts/).

By default, the provider will use the Mondoo CLI configuration file to authenticate to the Mondoo Platform. The CLI
configuration file is located at `~/.config/mondoo/mondoo.yml` on Linux and macOS, and `%HomePath%\mondoo\mondoo.yml`
on Windows.

You can alternatively use the `credentials` field, or any of the following environment variables ordered by precedence.

* `MONDOO_CONFIG_BASE64`
* `MONDOO_CONFIG_PATH`
* `MONDOO_API_TOKEN`
